# Pokémon Game Project with Pygame

## Description
This project is a Pokémon game developed with Pygame. It includes a battle system, a Pokédex, and Pokémon management via JSON files. The game also features battle animations to enhance the user experience.

The project is designed using object-oriented programming (OOP) to ensure a modular and reusable architecture. Each main entity of the game (Pokémon, Battle, Pokédex) is implemented as a class, making the code easier to extend and maintain.

## Features
- Graphical interface with Pygame
- Pokémon battle system
- Pokémon management via JSON files
- Interactive Pokédex
- Battle animations
- Code organization with a modular architecture based on object-oriented programming
- Interactive menu to navigate between different game features (battle, Pokédex, settings, etc.)
